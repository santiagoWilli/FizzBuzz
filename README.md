# FizzBuzz


FizzBuzz is a group word game for children to teach about division. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word *fizz* and any number divisible by five by the word *buzz*. Therefore, numbers divisible by 15 become *fizz buzz*.

**This FizzBuzz game was developed following TDD to show how tests should drive production code development.**
